## Command-line entry points
Run these from a regular shell — they work without launching the TUI.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `flowly`                   | Smart entry: opens this TUI when a provider is configured, else opens the first-run provider picker |
| `flowly login`             | Sign in with Flowly account (zero API keys, OAuth — opens browser) |
| `flowly login --repair`    | Re-wire relay config using existing tokens (no browser) — recovers from manually-edited or partially-restored config |
| `flowly login --repair --dry-run` | Show what `--repair` would change without writing anything |
| `flowly logout`            | Clear keychain tokens + relay config + active provider (mirrors `/logout`) |
| `flowly doctor`            | Read-only health check — tokens, relay, provider, gateway, sessions |
| `flowly doctor --fix`      | Auto-repair the issues `flowly doctor` flagged as fixable |
| `flowly setup`             | Open the TUI's provider picker (the one mandatory setup step) |
| `flowly setup channels`    | Open the channels catalog (Telegram / Discord / Slack) |
| `flowly setup tools`       | Open the integrations catalog (browser, voice, …) |
| `flowly setup byok <slug> --key <k>` | Quick BYOK one-shot: save key + (optionally) set active — for CI / dotfile bootstrap |
| `flowly`                   | Launch this TUI (when a provider is configured) |
| `flowly --theme catppuccin` | Launch with a specific TUI theme (catppuccin, synthwave, gruvbox...) |
| `flowly gateway`           | Run the gateway daemon (Telegram/iOS/Discord channels go through it) |
| `flowly status`            | One-line snapshot of model + provider + session |
| `flowly memory list`       | Show active long-term memories |
| `flowly memory review`     | Memories awaiting your review — accept / reject |
| `flowly memory dream`      | Learn durable facts from recent chats now (the cross-session "dreamer"; also runs automatically on idle/daily) |
| `flowly memory consolidate` | Merge duplicate + retire stale memories |
| `flowly --help`            | Full command tree with options |

## Status bar badges
| Glyph | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `● ready` / `⠹ thinking` / `○ offline` | Connection / busy state |
| `⚠ N approval` | N pending exec approvals — press F3 |
| `◆ N` | N artifacts available — press F4 |
| `1.2k↑ 345↓` | Tokens in / out for this session |

## Shell escape
- `!cmd` runs **bash command locally** — never sent to the LLM.
  Examples: `!ls`, `!git status`, `!pwd`.
- Output appears as a code block in the transcript.
- 30s timeout, 4000 char cap.

## Queueing
- Type while the agent is streaming: messages **queue** above the input.
- Queued messages auto-send when the current turn ends.
- Queue count shows in the status bar.

## Streaming
- A blinking `▌` cursor in the assistant bubble means tokens are still arriving.
- Tool calls render as colored lines with live elapsed seconds.
- The status bar shows an animated busy ticker (`thinking · 3.1s`).

## Sessions
- Sessions persist at `~/.flowly/data/sessions/`.
- TUI remembers your last session in `~/.flowly/tui_state.json`.
- Launch with `flowly --new` to start fresh, or `-s key` for a custom key.

## Sync scope
- **CLI sessions stay local.** Everything you type here is saved only
  to `~/.flowly/sessions/*.jsonl` on this machine. Nothing in the CLI
  ever goes to Firestore or the relay.
- **iOS / desktop / Android chats auto-sync** to your Flowly account
  via the relay — but only when you're signed in (`/login`). Those
  chats are a separate stream; they don't mix with this CLI session.
- `/login` pairs this machine so your iOS app can reach the gateway
  for tool execution. It does **not** start syncing CLI chats.
- The status bar's `🔒 local` badge is a permanent reminder that
  the active CLI session is on-disk-only.
